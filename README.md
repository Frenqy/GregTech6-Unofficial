## Introduction

This mod is an [unofficial but approved](https://forum.mechaenetia.com/tag/approved) continuation of [GregTech-6](https://github.com/GregTech6/gregtech6). 

Note: GT6 official branch is still being developed, though it will be mostly bugfixes, but also PRs. (Gregorious is going to make his own Game Mechaenetia ^^) And I will be merging official branch commits into GT6U. For details, visit this [post](https://forum.mechaenetia.com/t/gregtech-6-main-thread/34/168). 

The development work of GT6U is undertaken by development team GT6U-Team, and its development direction is to continue to improve the technology line of GT6 and add more practical equipment.

* Added dozens of new fluids to make the petroluem/organic chemistry tech tree more complete.

* Added an achievment page for an overview of Gregtech tech tree and milestones. 

* Added a variety of large machines, including large roasting oven, industrial coke oven, fuel cleaner, large dryer, cracking tower, particle collider, mask aligner, large heat mixer, draining well, biochemical research lab, large extruder, large crystallisation crucible, etc. 

* Added a variety of small machines, including circuit assembly machine, laser cutting machine, electric autoclave, heat mixer, incubator, etc.

* Brand new polymers: PVC, PTFE, Epoxid, and their derivatives (pipes, storage tanks, etc).

* Brand new chromite treatment.

* Adjusted the original circuitry manufacture to be more closely related to new polymers. 

* Diversified gameplay, such as nuclear power reactors that can be cooled with distilled water, coconut trees, water wells, etc. 

## Changelogs

## Upgrading from GT6 to GT6U

You can easily update your GT6 official world to GT6U by replacing the original GT6 jar file, but do NOTE that:

* Distillation Tower and Cryo Distillation Tower won't work with original design in GT6 official branch, but you can easily fix it by looking at the tooltips of the mainblocks.

* Fusion reactor now accepts LU as start energy while requires EU as maintain energy.

* Some recipes are changed so check NEI if you find out some of your machines not working.

If other bugs emerge when updating the world, submit a GitHub issue. (Just click the Issues button above)
