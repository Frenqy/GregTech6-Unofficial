Nothing


6.15.02: (Not released yet).
[WIP] Fusion Reactor Mk2 and Mk3 and their component blocks.
[WIP] New Fusion system.
The new systems will focus on two aspects of fusion:
1. New energy generation strategies based on Neutron Capture (NC) Design and Direct Voltage Conversion (DVC) Design.
NC Design:
A "Blanket" of neutron capture casings can be place on the fusion reactor's top or bottom to capture the neutrons emitted from the current recipe.
There are two aspects in Neutron Capture strategy.
Firstly, neutron capture casings is continued to be heated by the emitting neutrons. Coolants used to cool fission reactors can be filled in to cool the casings and carry the energy out as hot coolants, which can then be used in traditional heat-electricity conversions.
Secondly, the neutron capture casings can be filled with molten lithium to breed tritium for fusion or molten fission wastes to breed new fission fuels.
DVC Design:
The old plasma turbines will be replaced with direct energy conversion machines that converts Electric Energy directly from the charged plasma produced in the fusion reactors.
2. Maintenance
The fusion reactors will now also require input of super coolant like Liquid Nitrogen (minimum for Mk1), Liquid Helium (minimum for Mk2), or Liquid Hydrogen (minimum for Mk3) depending on the reactor level.
It will consume the coolant and output equivalent amount of gaseous coolant through time.
This means you have to prepare a system of cooling devices to support your fusion reactors.
To compensate for the increased maintenance cost and complexity, the energy production of fusion reactors will be boosted.
Building a self-sustaining fusion plant will be one of the final aims in GregTech.


6.15.01:
[NOTE] This is a Hotfix (Minor change).
[FIXED] Empty Laser Emitter requiring Circuit (T2) to craft, which makes it impossible to craft.


6.15.00:
[NOTE] Here I am back, merging Greg's big update :D .
[FIXED]
WarpDrive and Tinker's Gregwork does not recognize GT6U because I changed the main version on 6.14.02.
The version is now reverted, but just be aware of what you are using since GT6 official already updated to 6.14.
[CHANGED]
You can no longer synthesize elements after Iron in the periodic table in the Fusion Mk1 Reactor for now.
I will fix this on next release with major changes on Fusion reactor mechanics.
[MERGED] Official 6.14.00 - 6.14.01
- 6.14.01:
- [IMPORTANT] If you use Factorization, use Asie's Version of it from here https://asie.pl/files/mods/Factorization/ (the one with the highest number, without "-dev" at the end of it). The original is broken and may crash with CoFH-Core.
- [NOTE] Just a nice reminder because a bunch of Potion related Stuff happened this update: Ever since Version 6.05.34, using the Bathing Pot you can bath Food Items in a Potion to give the Food Item that Effect.
- [COMPAT] Twilight Forest
- Way better Ore Generation, and allowing Vanilla Ores again in there. GT5 Style Ore Generation is now completely gone from Twilight Forest. (Remember that Iron Ore is already having all its Recipes overridden by GT6)
- In case the Ores look familiar to you, I grabbed and sometimes modified some Textures from previous GT Versions for this.
- The 16 Vanilla-ish Ores that got added are what I think is the minimum viable amount of Ore Types that a GT6 World requires, if we account for the Byproducts.
- I also added the 8 Rock-Layer-Ores in Blob form to there, getting the total count of new Ores up to 24.
- Those specific 24 Ores are also not TileEntity based so the Ore Magnet and the Miner Tree work on those just fine.
- Some Ores only generate above Y=40, meaning you have to find a Hollow Hill, Hydra Cave, Yeti Cave or the Twilight Highlands for them, and some unimportant ones are also Biome dependent in order for them to not be spammed everywhere.
- Thaumcraft and Ars Magica will have their important Ores generate in the Enchanted Forest Biome when installed, even if their own Worldgen is disabled.
- Netherite Plus will have its Ancient Debris spawn in the Deadrock near the final Twilight Castle, so you don't have to go to the Nether for it.
- Bedrock Ores still exist in the Twilight Forest. I even fixed that the Indicator Flowers and Rocks were not generating all that often, due to the giant Leaf Canopy blocking the Generation-Ray-Trace from the Sky (which now ignores specifically Logs and Leaves).
- Solar Panels in Twilight Forest will perpetually produce 4 EU/t all time, so exactly half of what they make in the Overworld during Daytime.
- [COMPAT] OpenBlocks
- The Drain Cover works like an XP Drain when you stand ontop of it and Sneak. It will also absorb stray XP Orbs in front of it. (1 XP = 20L of Liquid XP)
- The Tap will give you one Level worth of XP when you rightclick it, as long as that much is available. Yes you have to click it 30 times if you wanna go all the way from level 0 to level 30.
- The regular and multiblock Furnace Ovens should have a Liquid XP Output along with the normal Item Outputs. Note that the Liquid XP Output Tank has unlimited Capacity unlike the ones of other Machines, so you do not need to worry about the XP stopping the Furnace from operating. The Tap can be useful to extract XP Orbs on an Oven by the way.
- [COMPAT] MineFactory Reloaded
- The Drain Cover can work like a Sewer for Mob Essence from XP Orbs, but only if OpenBlocks is not installed. You can generify Liquid XP into Mob Essence and vice versa. (1 XP = 66.666L of Mob Essence, yes it is such a crummy number)
- It will also work for Sewage from Adult Mobs, based on the Size of the Mob standing on it. Make sure their center is actually above the Drain, we dont want them to miss the Toilet do we?
- [COMPAT] RotaryCraft
- Tungsten Alloy and its direct Items now have Material Data. I think it got one of the most complicated Results in the Chemical Tooltip so far, closing in on the old Garnet Tooltips. XD
- The Flakes from Ore Processing can now be processed in more Machines than just the Furnace (like the Shredder or Sifter for example). Do note that most of those Recipes will output Dusts instead of Ingots now for somewhat obvious reasons. (I cant really do anything against the "Aluminum Dust" that the Ore Extractor outputs since it isn't Flakes)
- Also added Tungsten Alloy Drums, Anvils, Cells, Fluid Pipes, Storages, Shelves etc.
- [COMPAT] Netherlicious
- Netherlicious officially wont ever add Netherite, so the Netherite Plus Mod is still recommended for Netherite Items such as Armor, or the Twilight Forest Netherrite Ore Compat.
- Foxfire Planks are now in the GT6 Wood Dictionary.
- Crimson and Warped Wood Stuff from Netherite Plus are now overidden by Netherlicious Wood Stuff wherever applicable.
- The Mushroom Logs can now properly be made into their Beam counterparts using GT6 Tools.
- Its Food Stuff has more consistency with GT6 now.
- There is also additional ways to make Potions.
- Spectral Dew is a Type of "Nether Water" that can be used in many Recipes and even Boilers that require regular Water.
- [FIXED] Minor Serverside Lag of GT6 Electric Transformers when any IC2 is installed. This should reduce the occurences of it quite a bit, at least with other GT6 TileEntities adjacent to the GT6 Transformer.
- [FIXED] Unscanned Forestry Bees (and some other things) randomly became not properly stackable, whenever a GT6 thing storing them got unloaded and reloaded. (this wont fix any already done problems to the stackability)
- [FIXED] A very minor Localisation Bug with Prospecting on Servers.
- [FIXED] Some Wood Material Data for Erebus, Chisel and Netherite Plus.
- [FIXED] Double Chests should now work with Pipes, Hoppers and similar.
- [FIXED] The wrong Types of Honey and Milk were outputted by some Recipes.
- [FIXED] Twilight Forests dependance on Naga Scales/Trophies, Lich Scepters/Trophies and Hydra Blood/Trophies to trigger their Progress Achievements. Now you ONLY need the Trophy and not that extra Item. Also you can just rightclick a placed Trophy to get its Achievement too.
- [FIXED] Basic Machines were not outputting all their Fluids into Quadruple/Nonuple Pipes if one of the Fluids got Stuck.
- [FIXED] Radiation from Reactors should now not be as high if you are further away from them.
- [CHANGED] The Distillery no longer requires Blaze Rods. Netherwart is enough of a Gatekeeper for Potion Brewing.
- [CHANGED] In order to make Potions in the Distillery you have to use Distilled Water now. Normal Water wont work anymore.
- [CHANGED] Oil now burns in the Burning Box with the same total Power Value as "Fuel", due to being able to get way more Power with a Distillation Towers other additional Fuels later on. I also noticed Soulsand Oil did not have a burn Value so I added that too. You can also use the Distillery again for making Oil to Fuel and Lube at a loss.
- [CHANGED] Battery Boxes now only charge/discharge once per second instead of once per tick. Internal Capacity of the Boxes themselves has been adjusted for this change of Rate.
- [CHANGED] Certain Twilight Tools now have higher Durability so they aren't as "Single Use and Throw away" anymore as before. Applies to: Ore Magnet, Peacock Fan, Crumble Horn and Giant Pickaxe.
- [CHANGED] Twilight Forests Lamp of Cinders works as infinite Flint and Tinder on GT6 Machines and TNT, but it will not spawn Fire Blocks. Can also be used in the modified vanilla Furnace Recipe without being deleted.
- [CHANGED] Swords, Saws, Axes and similar made of Knightmetal or Fiery Steel can now be used to break Twilight Maze Hedges about 40 times faster too. But be sure to wear something protecting you from the 1.5 Hearts of "Cactus" Damage per broken Hedge. Also the Saw should be optimal for this since it autocollects Drops, or the Sense/Scythe due to the Area of Effect.
- [CHANGED] Bastnasite now has Nikolite/Teslatite/Electrotine as a Byproduct if the corresponding Mod exists. It also has an Ore Drop Factor of x3 now.
- [CHANGED] Bumblebees in Twilight Forest now have the same variety that the Overworld ones have.
- [CHANGED] If you non-sneak rightclick Bedrock Ores you will get the overall Bedrock Drill Recipe List in NEI, making it easier to discover what their use is. (Does not apply to Bedrock Fluid Springs, obviously)
- [CHANGED] If you set yourself on Fire and rightclick a GT6 Machine with your bare hand it will count as Igniting the Machine with a Flint and Tinder or similar.
- [ADDED] Red Clay, which is generating in the Nether now. Look at the big Lava Pools, it always generates at the same height.
- [ADDED] Wood Pellets can be turned into Charcoal in the Coke Oven now, which doubles the Fuel Value.
- [ADDED] All Basic Machines now have a Screwdriver Mode, which allows them to not accept more Items in their Input Slots once there is already a Stack inside. This makes precision inserting of Inputs using "Exact Mode Hoppers" and Item Pipes into a Bank of multiple Machines much easier than what you had to do before with Redstone, Shutters and Progress Sensors.
- [ADDED] Thaumcraft Flowers and Saplings should now generate in certain Biomes in the Twilight Forest.
- [ADDED] Recipe for the Name Tag. Yes that did not exist so far in GT6... I somehow forgot adding that one and thought I already did add it...
- [ADDED] Transformation Powder can now be used to turn Mob Spawners into their Twilight Forest Variant and back. You will need 16 Powder at a time for it to work though. I also added some additional Mappings for Spawners just in case.
- [ADDED] The Cube of Annihilation of Twilight Forest is now craftable using a bunch of different Trophies and Loot Items.
- [ADDED] The 36 Trees from Harvestcraft to the Wood Dictionary. Yes I know they mostly use Vanilla Leaves and Logs. Maple and Cinnamon will have their GT6 Counterpart of Beams and Planks assigned.
- [ADDED] Harvestcraft Crops to the List of things that can randomly spawn in the Farming Room in GT6 Dungeons.
- [ADDED] Amethyst Mortar, because there is Situations where Amethysts/Ender-Amethysts are actually more common than Diamonds, Rubies and Sapphires.
- [ADDED] Wooden Buckets for Soy Milk, Glue and Spectral Dew.
- [ADDED] Bedrock Diamond Ore. About twice as rare as Bedrock Gold Ore. Also Pink Diamond is now a Byproduct of regular Diamond.
-
- 6.14.00:
- [NOTE]
- The Thaumic Fixer Mod by Chocohead is no longer needed nor compatible!
- We have our own Version of it now, which also works with more than just ~3 specific Mods... He really fucked up that one...
- This Version of the hack is also compatible with Reikas Mods, unlike Chocoheads.
- [NOTE]
- Bugs that might have happened to a few things, that I might have overlooked could exist, such as:
- "Recipes for certain wooden Items being uncraftable, because of the general Wood Type overhaul"
- "Some random thing might Crash when updating from 6.13 to 6.14 because the ASM Code is not tested with ALL the Mods" (I am very confident this wont happen though, just not confident enough to not mention it at the very least)
- [COMPAT] CoFH-Core should now much less likely crash SinglePlayer Worlds on Startup with the FMLProxyPacket Race Condition. OvermindDL1 made an ASM® thingy to fix it, so my original brutal way isn't needed anymore.
- [COMPAT] TerraFirmaCraft(Plus) Stuff should work slightly better now. TFC Sticks and Torches are now being accounted for when doing Recipe Outputs.
- [IMPROVED] The Extender Manual now has a few more Lines to explain what Extenders are actually doing. I also added a Tooltip to Two-Faced Energy Converters (such as the Thermoelectric Cooler) to remind people that Universal Extenders do exist and can be used to literally cut Corners, when there is no "Thermal Conductor Wires" or similar available.
- [FIXED] An Issue reading Configs on Apple based File Systems (certain Config Files were deleted). I did not think Apple could do a mix of the Windows way and the Linux way of handling Case Sensitivity in File Names to the point of causing this.
- [FIXED] Fluid Tanks/Pipes with huge Capacities should no longer be limited to Integer.MAX_VALUE anymore.
- [FIXED] Lava Blocks should no longer set NON-flammable things on Fire, just because they are made of Wood. (GT Fireproof Wood for example, Forestry Fireproof Wood is wrongly implemented sadly)
- [FIXED] Some things I saw GT6U has fixed too, like TFC Damage Multipliers for Heat and Frost Damage.
- [FIXED] Whoops, I made Titanium Invisible by accident.
- [FIXED] Crash with IC2 when High Level Radiation Effects are applied, like the ones from Neutronium.
- [FIXED] There was ~5 second long Lag Spikes, when certain Recipes were asked for, by the On-Demand Recipe System. Specifically Recipes with Selector Tags, Extruder Shapes or Fluids (Sawmill), aswell as Recipes with Empty Slots in the Anvil (Item Casings).
- [FIXED] Drones just vanished instead of dieing during the Bumblebee Breeding Process in a Bumbliary. Now there actually is Corpses for the dead breeding Drones too.
- [CHANGED] Certain Worldgen Features will no longer be present in the Overworld when TerraFirmaCraft is loaded.
- [CHANGED] Made Pincers and the Plunger the right Tool to harvest the Dragon Egg and Dragon-Egg-like Mod Blocks. The Vanilla Dragon Egg still teleports though!
- [CHANGED] Technically speaking, Shovels/Spades/Plows and such should be able to break Fire now, BUT due to the nature of how you click Fire to break it, that wont directly work. This is just a special case in case a Mod adds a Block that uses the Material "Fire", so that it can be harvested somehow.
- [CHANGED] Crates now use Crowbar Harvesting to drop their Contents instead of Rightclicking with Crowbar. Also works with the Universal Spade.
- [CHANGED] Crates can now be made with Wooden and Plastic Screws too. Iron based Screws were maybe a little bit of a too difficult requirement for this kind of thing.
- [CHANGED] Pipe/Wire Selection Boxes and placement Behavior for the better.
- [ADDED] Zeolite to Dungeon Loot Chests just to make sure people can find it by accident.
- [ADDED] Pickaxes and Drills made of Knightmetal or Fiery Steel can now be used to break Twilight Maze Walls about 40 times faster. The Construction Pickaxe is faster than the regular Pickaxe in this case, since the Maze Bricks dont count as natural.
- [ADDED] Tapes can now be put in Shelves. Remote Activators can also be put in Shelves now, but are hidden as a Book like most things you might not want people to notice, such as Levers or Keys.
- [ADDED] The Shelf in Workshops in GT6 Dungeons now contains two Rolls of Tape, which is always enough to haul both of the Stone Mass Storages and then some.
- [ADDED] Farming themed Room to GT6 Dungeons to showcase the Universal Flower Pot and a good use for Glowtus as Covering for the Water Hole in Farms.
- [ADDED]
- The Coconut Tree from GT6U got Backported, and has been given proper development. No longer a tall Hazel Tree Ripoff.
- These Trees will grow at Beach Biomes, aswell as most Tropical and Oasis Biomes.
- Due to the lower amount of Leaves, they have a higher Sapling rate than any other GT6 Tree to compensate.
- You might have found those "Work in Progress" Saplings in random Chests in Dungeons and such, now they are all growable.
- The dropped Coconuts behave just like other Mods Coconuts in GT6 Recipes, and if you didn't have such Mods, you can make Coconut Milk, Coconut Cream and similar now.
- [ADDED]
- Dedicated Wood Materials for many Types of Wood.
- This will influence basically every common Wood ITEM. Ofcourse the Generifier works on all of them.
- Sticks generated on the ground in the World can have different Materials like Rotten, Mossy or Dead Wood aswell as Biome specific Variants (Birch Forest Biome = Birch Sticks). They can be used like normal Sticks.
- The NEI Tree Family GUI also got 6 more Slots now to display which amounts of Sticks/Pulp/Bark/Charcoal you can get from each Type of Tree.
- Many Crates that contain Wood Planks now have this variety too. Some of these Crates can also be found in GT6 Dungeons in a new Pile that isn't the Metal Crates.
- Forestry Stuff can now be Fire Proofed like the GT6 and Vanilla Logs/Beams/Planks. (Forgot to add those Recipes to my Stuff initially)


6.14.07:
[NOTE] I am busy during this end of 2020 and will not be able to update GT6u again until around 2021 February.
You can still report any bug or suggestion you found in GT6u. See you then.
[FIXED] Fuel Cleaner now auto-searches for any kind of sulfured fuel that are in the fluid slots of it. And it will automatically change to execute that fuel cleaning recipe.
[COMPAT] Compatibility with TFC & TFC-Plus food system. GT Foods can now be consumed when Terra Firma Craft is installed and they have the five tastes (sweetness, sourness, bitterness, saltiness, and savory) in TFC now.

6.14.06:
[FIXED] MESU cannot save energy correctly.
[FIXED] Perforated Bushing having wrong material information.
[CHANGED] Increased the yield of Epoxid Resin and Photoresist production.
[CHANGED] Degraded IV Batteries capacity and their recipes are now like before.
[CHANGED] NEI recipes no longer display that misleading "Tier".
[ADDED] Multiblock Energy Storage Unit (MESU).
Its dimensions can be changed in a range, providing different voltages and energy capacity. Longer it is, higher voltage it has. Larger it is, greater capacity it has.
Use a screwdriver to alter its current output, up to 32 Amps.
[ADDED] Lithium-F-Phosphate, a salt used in Li-ion battery electrolyte, Ethyl Methyl Carbonate.
[ADDED] Six battery cores for MESU. Each has different capacity.
[ADDED] Two battery electrode parts for MESU. Each allows different length-voltage multiplier of the battery.

6.14.05:
Broken, do not use!

6.14.04:
[NOTE] This is not a really important update, just for the hotfix. I will not merge GT6 until the Asmization is tested with some time.
[FIXED] MacOs File System causes some config files to reset during launch.

6.14.03:
[COMPAT] When TerraFirmaCraft or TerraFirmaCraft Plus is loaded, the heat, electric, and chemical damage is accommodated.
[FIXED] Titanium not showing up in NEI.
[FIXED] Biochemical Research Lab cannot form in some direction of facing.
[FIXED] Fermenting recipe conflicts.
[CHANGED] Less time is now required to incubate the biomass-origin bacterias.

6.14.02:
[NOTE] This is a quite major update, read the changelog before update is recommended...
[MERGED] Merged official branch 6.13.02
- 6.13.02:
- [COMPAT] HBM Nuclear Tech has some more Compatiblity Data attached to it. Mainly Shelf Data. The Alloys it has are a little bit too weird.
- [COMPAT] HEXCrafts Hexorium Ore is generated in all possible ways when installed, with RGB ones closer to Surface and Black and White ones closer to Bedrock. Also some Hexorium related Recipes added. Its Energized Monoliths can also be found as Decoration in GT Dungeons.
- [FIXED] A weird Interaction with Robot Arms and Extenders that resulted in Extenders sometimes choosing the secondary Facing as destination for Items, even though the Items did not come from the promary Facing, including targetting things like GT6 Red Alloy Wires that dont even have Slots to put shit into, resulting in a Crash of the Block that has the Robot Arm.
- [FIXED] Tooltips for Mob Spawn Proofing will now show it whenever Optifine breaks the mechanic in Singleplayer, because clearly removing Metadata support from World functions is a good Idea and "totally fixable" on my end...
- [FIXED] GT6 Redstone Wiring sometimes checked multiple/infinite times per tick for Vanilla signals. This was leading to Game Freezes with Thermal Expansion.
- [FIXED] Some Biomes from Enhanced Biomes were not counted as River for my Worldgen.
- [FIXED] Skeletons were not shooting the right GT Arrows since a long time. Now I made an actual List of Arrows to shoot, instead of grabbing any of the existing Arrows. This also means no Radiation Arrow shooting Skeletons anymore.
- [FIXED] Made Config Files always migrate to Lowercase File Names so random Garbage with Windows and older Config Files wont happen again.
- [CHANGED] The Capsule and Cell Extruder Recipes were not really well coded, so I fixed them up. Should make it easier to work with for the GT6U Team too.
- [CHANGED] Moderated Reactor Rods now lose durability twice as fast compared to what it was before.
- [CHANGED] Molten Midasium is now able to turn Lead into Gold at a ratio of 1 Midasium + 4 Lead = 4 Gold. This is better than using a Generifier on Midasium to directly make it into Gold 1:1.
- [ADDED] There is now small Rocks in the Nether, some of which contain tiny amounts of Ancient Debris, and are as rare as Meteorites on the Surface. Glowstone, NetherQuartz and Flint can be found in them too.
- [ADDED] Config to disable the nutrition System for Sugar, Fat and Dehydration. Alcohol and Caffeine stay though, since those are definitely things people intentionally consume for buffs and such.
- [ADDED] Netherite Drum, Fluid Pipes/Capsules and Anvil. Netherite also counts as Acid Proof now, due to its high Gold content. Also added Gold Fluid Pipes/Capsules while I was at it.
- [ADDED] Laser-O-Meter Sensor for Laser Fiber Wires.
[FIXED] Recipe for Titanium Niobium Carbide Dynamo Mainblock.
[FIXED] Recipe for Titanium Niobium Carbide Turbine Mainblock.
[FIXED] Recipes for Large Mass Fab and Mass Replicator Mainblocks are the same.
[FIXED] When centrifuging energy crystal dust you can get more sapphire dust.
[FIXED] A log error of NetheritePlus recipe when NePl is not loaded.
[CHANGED] The Mod name is now 'GregTech 6 Unofficial' to avoid ambiguity.
[CHANGED] Thanks to Greg notifying me that dust not being able to put into Extruders will cause plastic and similar materials unable to be processed into capsules, etc. I reverted the change so Extruders can process them now again.
[CHANGED] Fusion Reactor Mk1 now requires LU for start energy and EU for the maintaining energy. Since a Tokamak design is used here, electricity should be used to maintain the current in the coils.
[CHANGED] PVC production yield now decrease.
[CHANGED] There is now a config option to choose whether Long distance pipes can be crafted with less material.
[CHANGED] Renamed Oil Cleaner into Fuel Cleaner.
[CHANGED] Lowered the cost of Fuel Cleaner and Clean stainless steel machine casing.
[CHANGED] Altered the time cost for fuel cleaning in mixer and fuel cleaner so that it is more balanced.
[CHANGED] Fermenting recipes now needs a Selector Tag.
[CHANGED] When fermenting Biomass from biological resources, you can choose to boost its efficiency by providing Biomass Flora.
[CHANGED] Now you need more Idun Golden Apple Juice, Idun Apple Juice, and Golden Carrot Juice to ferment biomass.
[CHANGED] IV batteries are now made in Welder with higher cost.
[CHANGED] Circuit Plate is now named as Plastic Circuit Plate.
[CHANGED] The Circuit production is majorly changed. Different Circuits now need different Circuit Plates to craft, and you need Electro-Etching solution to make Circuit Board.
[CHANGED] Press now have fluid input and output.
[ADDED] GT6U Achievement Page and some Achievements.
[ADDED] Biology Item Group. Note: Many things in this group are in no way useful at current version. This is somewhat a WIP process.
[ADDED] Large Extruder. A Multiblock using EU that is able to do 64 parallel recipes with 50% efficiency.
[ADDED] Large Crystallisation Crucible. A Multiblock using HU that is able to do 64 parallel recipes.
[ADDED] Draining Well. A Multiblock that drains water from underground using RU. This is an alternative to Infinite Water for some modpacks.
[ADDED] Biochemical Research Laboratory. Multiblock machine. Requires LU to start for most recipes as Disinfection Cost.
[ADDED] Coconut Tree and its derivatives. Also its compat for Binnie's Mods. They are likely to grow along beach and swamp area.
[ADDED] 4 Kinds of Bacterias and Biomass Flora Bacteria cluster. These bacterias are helpful to increase efficiency in fermenting and producing organic gases.
[ADDED] Ethanol, Methane, and Hydrogen can now be produced by different bacteris with biomass and required nutrition or environment fluids in the Incubator.
[ADDED] Phenolic Circuit Plate, Epoxid Circuit Plate, Multilayer Epoxid Circuit Plate, Aluminium Printed Circuit Plate, Perforated Bushing, and Fibreglass.

6.14.01:
[NOTE] Do not use 6.14.00, it will crash the game.
[MERGED]Merged official branch 6.13.01
- 6.13.01:
- [FIXED] a Bug that crashes every single Crafting Recipe, sorry about that lol.
- [FIXED] Some Localisation Issues with Reika's Fluids, it should be fine now. It will work with all other Unlocalized Fluids too, so GT6 will display the most proper Fluid Name that it can display now.
- 6.13.00
- [NOTE] Sorry for letting this one take so long.
- [NOTE] I got a report that Riverwater, Swampwater and Oceanwater cannot be scanned with the Thaumometer, I can not replicate that Issue though, so I guess it is either fixed or something is wrong with their Modpack.
- [COMPAT] Netherite Plus got Compatibility now. It backports Netherite to 1.7.10. Soulfire Torch Placement by Tools, Record Shelving, Blackstone, Biomass, and the two Wood Types should all work in GregTech Stuff, also Netherite Ingots are made the Crucible way now instead of Crafting Debris with Gold Ingots. https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/netheriteplus
- [FIXED] Seems like QwertTech might have messed up the Recipes for putting Planks in a Bathing Pot to get Treated Wood. This Issue might be fixed now for Vanilla Planks.
- [FIXED] The GT6 Axe was still slowed down on my end, when TreeCapitator was actually installed, resulting in a Double Slowdown.
- [FIXED] Heat Exchangers and Diesel Motors were wasting Fuel in certain Situations. Typically when they were operated while constantly out of Fuel.
- [FIXED] Failing to Load Save Files in Singleplayer when you already loaded another World before.
- [FIXED] Pam's Harvestcraft Fishtrap Bait Recipe for Mixing Bowl had a lower amount of Output than intended.
- [FIXED] Thaumcraft Golems were not chopping GT6 Logs, because it checks for the wrong OreDict String, and because it checks for Block IDs using Block Objects which is kinda screwed up, so I had to fix that too.
- [FIXED] 7 Bits are definitely not enough to store Numbers that can go up to 12 Billion. Fusion Reactor Start Energy is now properly saved when unloaded.
- [FIXED] Terrafirmacraft Plus not being detected as Terrafirmacraft.
- [FIXED] Clay Ore that comes from Hematite Bedrock Drilling is now processable.
- [FIXED] Some Ars Magica Unification things.
- [FIXED] The way I overrode the Railcraft Plate Names was kinda jank so I made it use the GregTech Language File now.
- [FIXED] JABBA Dollys can no longer pick up GT6 Shelves. Somehow they were still able to be picked up even though I prevented them from working on GT Blocks as a whole, ages ago.
- [FIXED] Infinite Items Glitch caused by InvTweaks making 111 Stacks and NEI keeping those at an Infinite Level, causing Infinite Item Duplication, if a Stack with higher than its custom Maximum Size enters a GT6 GUI Slot, while the GUI is being kept open. Now if that happens I will just cap the Stacksize at 64, potentially deleting Items, but that is what you get for InvTweaks being screwed up.
- [CHANGED] When Machines can process multiple Items in a row in one go, they wont process more than a Minutes worth of Stuff at a time, assuming maximum Power Input. This applies to things like the Crusher, Sifter, Compressor, Squeezer, Electrolyzer and Centrifuge for example.
- [CHANGED] Bath Recipes that have an Output Stacksize of more than 1 now have their Outputs spread over the 6 Output Slots. This should make it easier to parallel process Ores in a Multiblock Bath. (I may or may not have slightly buffed the Outputs of some Ore Recipes too)
- [CHANGED] Blastproofness Tooltip now also mentions Strong Dynamite Proofness and doesn't stop at TNT-Proof anymore.
- [CHANGED] NEI Fuel Lists are now no longer listing the confusing and irrelevant EU/t Value.
- [CHANGED] More Reactor Test Stuffs from Erik3003.
- [CHANGED] Crucibles now glow when they are within 100 Kelvin of melting down.
- [ADDED] Netherite things, such as Crucibles, Burning Boxes and all the Shelf Stuff. The Crucible Tier is same as Meteoric Steel. The good Netherite Tools are made by bathing Diamond in molten Netherite. The bad Netherite Tools are, well, not that good. Ancient Debris does generate in the Nether now as rare small Ore.
- [ADDED] Infinite Bedrock Veins for Ancient Debris in the Nether. Relatively high Probability compared to all other Bedrock Veins. Will also exist without Netherrite Plus.
- [ADDED] Ancient Debris aka "Netherite Scraps" can now be used in the Massfabricator to make liquid Enderpearl. Which then can be used in a Replicator to make it into an actual Enderpearl. Dont ask me what sense it makes, the Massfabricator does it, not me.
- [ADDED] The HV Lightning Processor can be used to turn Blocks of Solid Netherite combined with a few other Ingredients into Netherstars.
- [ADDED] Uranium Hexaflouride Processing Chain by Erik3003. And fixed by Greg, because the Maths of the Recipes were "Perfectly Balanced without Exploits", except for the obvious dupes of every single Recipe added.
- [ADDED] Ownership Reset Config for people who locked themselves out of Stuff like Mechanical Safes in SinglePlayer.
- [ADDED] Small Cinnabar Ore to the Nether.
- [ADDED] Ars Magica Chimerite Ore when it is installed.
- [ADDED] Steam can now be put in Chem Tubes.
- [ADDED]
- Erik3003s Nuclear Reactor changes made it into this Version.
- He wrote a PDF as a Guide too, which I linked on the Downloads Page, and also here: https://gregtech.mechaenetia.com/1.7.10/gt6fission.pdf
- 6.12.02:
- [NOTE] This one automatically triggers the outdated Major Version Notification to nonupdated Users (once it is released), because ofcourse the first one or two of a Major Version tend to be buggy.
- [FIXED] TerraFirmaCraft Attack Damage Multiplier for GT6 Tools to be 80 instead of 10 and actually showing in the Tooltip.
- [FIXED] Thaumcraft Aspects for Nuggets and Ingots now check if they are supposed to be Metallum, and if not, then they will replace it with Ordo.
- [FIXED] Reactors blew up when no Coolant was in them while a minimal amount of Power was left over and they did not have any Rods.
- [FIXED] IC2-Classic Watermills should now accept Ocean and River Water. This requires a pending update on the IC2-Classic Side aswell.
