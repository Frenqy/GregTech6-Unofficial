6.14.07:
[NOTE] I am busy during this end of 2020 and will not be able to update GT6u again until around 2021 February.
You can still report any bug or suggestion you found in GT6u. See you then.
[FIXED] Fuel Cleaner now auto-searches for any kind of sulfured fuel that are in the fluid slots of it. And it will automatically change to execute that fuel cleaning recipe.
[COMPAT] Compatibility with TFC & TFC-Plus food system. GT Foods can now be consumed when Terra Firma Craft is installed and they have the five tastes (sweetness, sourness, bitterness, saltiness, and savory) in TFC now.

6.14.06:
[FIXED] MESU cannot save energy correctly.
[FIXED] Perforated Bushing having wrong material information.
[CHANGED] Increased the yield of Epoxid Resin and Photoresist production.
[CHANGED] Degraded IV Batteries capacity and their recipes are now like before.
[CHANGED] NEI recipes no longer display that misleading "Tier".
[ADDED] Multiblock Energy Storage Unit (MESU).
Its dimensions can be changed in a range, providing different voltages and energy capacity. Longer it is, higher voltage it has. Larger it is, greater capacity it has.
Use a screwdriver to alter its current output, up to 32 Amps.
[ADDED] Lithium-F-Phosphate, a salt used in Li-ion battery electrolyte, Ethyl Methyl Carbonate.
[ADDED] Six battery cores for MESU. Each has different capacity.
[ADDED] Two battery electrode parts for MESU. Each allows different length-voltage multiplier of the battery.

6.14.05:
Broken, do not use!

6.14.04:
[NOTE] This is not a really important update, just for the hotfix. I will not merge GT6 until the Asmization is tested with some time.
[FIXED] MacOs File System causes some config files to reset during launch.

6.14.03:
[COMPAT] When TerraFirmaCraft or TerraFirmaCraft Plus is loaded, the heat, electric, and chemical damage is accommodated.
[FIXED] Titanium not showing up in NEI.
[FIXED] Biochemical Research Lab cannot form in some direction of facing.
[FIXED] Fermenting recipe conflicts.
[CHANGED] Less time is now required to incubate the biomass-origin bacterias.

6.14.02:
[NOTE] This is a quite major update, read the changelog before update is recommended...
[MERGED] Merged official branch 6.13.02
- 6.13.02:
- [COMPAT] HBM Nuclear Tech has some more Compatiblity Data attached to it. Mainly Shelf Data. The Alloys it has are a little bit too weird.
- [COMPAT] HEXCrafts Hexorium Ore is generated in all possible ways when installed, with RGB ones closer to Surface and Black and White ones closer to Bedrock. Also some Hexorium related Recipes added. Its Energized Monoliths can also be found as Decoration in GT Dungeons.
- [FIXED] A weird Interaction with Robot Arms and Extenders that resulted in Extenders sometimes choosing the secondary Facing as destination for Items, even though the Items did not come from the promary Facing, including targetting things like GT6 Red Alloy Wires that dont even have Slots to put shit into, resulting in a Crash of the Block that has the Robot Arm.
- [FIXED] Tooltips for Mob Spawn Proofing will now show it whenever Optifine breaks the mechanic in Singleplayer, because clearly removing Metadata support from World functions is a good Idea and "totally fixable" on my end...
- [FIXED] GT6 Redstone Wiring sometimes checked multiple/infinite times per tick for Vanilla signals. This was leading to Game Freezes with Thermal Expansion.
- [FIXED] Some Biomes from Enhanced Biomes were not counted as River for my Worldgen.
- [FIXED] Skeletons were not shooting the right GT Arrows since a long time. Now I made an actual List of Arrows to shoot, instead of grabbing any of the existing Arrows. This also means no Radiation Arrow shooting Skeletons anymore.
- [FIXED] Made Config Files always migrate to Lowercase File Names so random Garbage with Windows and older Config Files wont happen again.
- [CHANGED] The Capsule and Cell Extruder Recipes were not really well coded, so I fixed them up. Should make it easier to work with for the GT6U Team too.
- [CHANGED] Moderated Reactor Rods now lose durability twice as fast compared to what it was before.
- [CHANGED] Molten Midasium is now able to turn Lead into Gold at a ratio of 1 Midasium + 4 Lead = 4 Gold. This is better than using a Generifier on Midasium to directly make it into Gold 1:1.
- [ADDED] There is now small Rocks in the Nether, some of which contain tiny amounts of Ancient Debris, and are as rare as Meteorites on the Surface. Glowstone, NetherQuartz and Flint can be found in them too.
- [ADDED] Config to disable the nutrition System for Sugar, Fat and Dehydration. Alcohol and Caffeine stay though, since those are definitely things people intentionally consume for buffs and such.
- [ADDED] Netherite Drum, Fluid Pipes/Capsules and Anvil. Netherite also counts as Acid Proof now, due to its high Gold content. Also added Gold Fluid Pipes/Capsules while I was at it.
- [ADDED] Laser-O-Meter Sensor for Laser Fiber Wires.
[FIXED] Recipe for Titanium Niobium Carbide Dynamo Mainblock.
[FIXED] Recipe for Titanium Niobium Carbide Turbine Mainblock.
[FIXED] Recipes for Large Mass Fab and Mass Replicator Mainblocks are the same.
[FIXED] When centrifuging energy crystal dust you can get more sapphire dust.
[FIXED] A log error of NetheritePlus recipe when NePl is not loaded.
[CHANGED] The Mod name is now 'GregTech 6 Unofficial' to avoid ambiguity.
[CHANGED] Thanks to Greg notifying me that dust not being able to put into Extruders will cause plastic and similar materials unable to be processed into capsules, etc. I reverted the change so Extruders can process them now again.
[CHANGED] Fusion Reactor Mk1 now requires LU for start energy and EU for the maintaining energy. Since a Tokamak design is used here, electricity should be used to maintain the current in the coils.
[CHANGED] PVC production yield now decrease.
[CHANGED] There is now a config option to choose whether Long distance pipes can be crafted with less material.
[CHANGED] Renamed Oil Cleaner into Fuel Cleaner.
[CHANGED] Lowered the cost of Fuel Cleaner and Clean stainless steel machine casing.
[CHANGED] Altered the time cost for fuel cleaning in mixer and fuel cleaner so that it is more balanced.
[CHANGED] Fermenting recipes now needs a Selector Tag.
[CHANGED] When fermenting Biomass from biological resources, you can choose to boost its efficiency by providing Biomass Flora.
[CHANGED] Now you need more Idun Golden Apple Juice, Idun Apple Juice, and Golden Carrot Juice to ferment biomass.
[CHANGED] IV batteries are now made in Welder with higher cost.
[CHANGED] Circuit Plate is now named as Plastic Circuit Plate.
[CHANGED] The Circuit production is majorly changed. Different Circuits now need different Circuit Plates to craft, and you need Electro-Etching solution to make Circuit Board.
[CHANGED] Press now have fluid input and output.
[ADDED] GT6U Achievement Page and some Achievements.
[ADDED] Biology Item Group. Note: Many things in this group are in no way useful at current version. This is somewhat a WIP process.
[ADDED] Large Extruder. A Multiblock using EU that is able to do 64 parallel recipes with 50% efficiency.
[ADDED] Large Crystallisation Crucible. A Multiblock using HU that is able to do 64 parallel recipes.
[ADDED] Draining Well. A Multiblock that drains water from underground using RU. This is an alternative to Infinite Water for some modpacks.
[ADDED] Biochemical Research Laboratory. Multiblock machine. Requires LU to start for most recipes as Disinfection Cost.
[ADDED] Coconut Tree and its derivatives. Also its compat for Binnie's Mods. They are likely to grow along beach and swamp area.
[ADDED] 4 Kinds of Bacterias and Biomass Flora Bacteria cluster. These bacterias are helpful to increase efficiency in fermenting and producing organic gases.
[ADDED] Ethanol, Methane, and Hydrogen can now be produced by different bacteris with biomass and required nutrition or environment fluids in the Incubator.
[ADDED] Phenolic Circuit Plate, Epoxid Circuit Plate, Multilayer Epoxid Circuit Plate, Aluminium Printed Circuit Plate, Perforated Bushing, and Fibreglass.

6.14.01:
[NOTE] Do not use 6.14.00, it will crash the game.
[MERGED]Merged official branch 6.13.01
- 6.13.01:
- [FIXED] a Bug that crashes every single Crafting Recipe, sorry about that lol.
- [FIXED] Some Localisation Issues with Reika's Fluids, it should be fine now. It will work with all other Unlocalized Fluids too, so GT6 will display the most proper Fluid Name that it can display now.
- 6.13.00
- [NOTE] Sorry for letting this one take so long.
- [NOTE] I got a report that Riverwater, Swampwater and Oceanwater cannot be scanned with the Thaumometer, I can not replicate that Issue though, so I guess it is either fixed or something is wrong with their Modpack.
- [COMPAT] Netherite Plus got Compatibility now. It backports Netherite to 1.7.10. Soulfire Torch Placement by Tools, Record Shelving, Blackstone, Biomass, and the two Wood Types should all work in GregTech Stuff, also Netherite Ingots are made the Crucible way now instead of Crafting Debris with Gold Ingots. https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/netheriteplus
- [FIXED] Seems like QwertTech might have messed up the Recipes for putting Planks in a Bathing Pot to get Treated Wood. This Issue might be fixed now for Vanilla Planks.
- [FIXED] The GT6 Axe was still slowed down on my end, when TreeCapitator was actually installed, resulting in a Double Slowdown.
- [FIXED] Heat Exchangers and Diesel Motors were wasting Fuel in certain Situations. Typically when they were operated while constantly out of Fuel.
- [FIXED] Failing to Load Save Files in Singleplayer when you already loaded another World before.
- [FIXED] Pam's Harvestcraft Fishtrap Bait Recipe for Mixing Bowl had a lower amount of Output than intended.
- [FIXED] Thaumcraft Golems were not chopping GT6 Logs, because it checks for the wrong OreDict String, and because it checks for Block IDs using Block Objects which is kinda screwed up, so I had to fix that too.
- [FIXED] 7 Bits are definitely not enough to store Numbers that can go up to 12 Billion. Fusion Reactor Start Energy is now properly saved when unloaded.
- [FIXED] Terrafirmacraft Plus not being detected as Terrafirmacraft.
- [FIXED] Clay Ore that comes from Hematite Bedrock Drilling is now processable.
- [FIXED] Some Ars Magica Unification things.
- [FIXED] The way I overrode the Railcraft Plate Names was kinda jank so I made it use the GregTech Language File now.
- [FIXED] JABBA Dollys can no longer pick up GT6 Shelves. Somehow they were still able to be picked up even though I prevented them from working on GT Blocks as a whole, ages ago.
- [FIXED] Infinite Items Glitch caused by InvTweaks making 111 Stacks and NEI keeping those at an Infinite Level, causing Infinite Item Duplication, if a Stack with higher than its custom Maximum Size enters a GT6 GUI Slot, while the GUI is being kept open. Now if that happens I will just cap the Stacksize at 64, potentially deleting Items, but that is what you get for InvTweaks being screwed up.
- [CHANGED] When Machines can process multiple Items in a row in one go, they wont process more than a Minutes worth of Stuff at a time, assuming maximum Power Input. This applies to things like the Crusher, Sifter, Compressor, Squeezer, Electrolyzer and Centrifuge for example.
- [CHANGED] Bath Recipes that have an Output Stacksize of more than 1 now have their Outputs spread over the 6 Output Slots. This should make it easier to parallel process Ores in a Multiblock Bath. (I may or may not have slightly buffed the Outputs of some Ore Recipes too)
- [CHANGED] Blastproofness Tooltip now also mentions Strong Dynamite Proofness and doesn't stop at TNT-Proof anymore.
- [CHANGED] NEI Fuel Lists are now no longer listing the confusing and irrelevant EU/t Value.
- [CHANGED] More Reactor Test Stuffs from Erik3003.
- [CHANGED] Crucibles now glow when they are within 100 Kelvin of melting down.
- [ADDED] Netherite things, such as Crucibles, Burning Boxes and all the Shelf Stuff. The Crucible Tier is same as Meteoric Steel. The good Netherite Tools are made by bathing Diamond in molten Netherite. The bad Netherite Tools are, well, not that good. Ancient Debris does generate in the Nether now as rare small Ore.
- [ADDED] Infinite Bedrock Veins for Ancient Debris in the Nether. Relatively high Probability compared to all other Bedrock Veins. Will also exist without Netherrite Plus.
- [ADDED] Ancient Debris aka "Netherite Scraps" can now be used in the Massfabricator to make liquid Enderpearl. Which then can be used in a Replicator to make it into an actual Enderpearl. Dont ask me what sense it makes, the Massfabricator does it, not me.
- [ADDED] The HV Lightning Processor can be used to turn Blocks of Solid Netherite combined with a few other Ingredients into Netherstars.
- [ADDED] Uranium Hexaflouride Processing Chain by Erik3003. And fixed by Greg, because the Maths of the Recipes were "Perfectly Balanced without Exploits", except for the obvious dupes of every single Recipe added.
- [ADDED] Ownership Reset Config for people who locked themselves out of Stuff like Mechanical Safes in SinglePlayer.
- [ADDED] Small Cinnabar Ore to the Nether.
- [ADDED] Ars Magica Chimerite Ore when it is installed.
- [ADDED] Steam can now be put in Chem Tubes.
- [ADDED]
- Erik3003s Nuclear Reactor changes made it into this Version.

- 6.12.02:
- [NOTE] This one automatically triggers the outdated Major Version Notification to nonupdated Users (once it is released), because ofcourse the first one or two of a Major Version tend to be buggy.
- [FIXED] TerraFirmaCraft Attack Damage Multiplier for GT6 Tools to be 80 instead of 10 and actually showing in the Tooltip.
- [FIXED] Thaumcraft Aspects for Nuggets and Ingots now check if they are supposed to be Metallum, and if not, then they will replace it with Ordo.
- [FIXED] Reactors blew up when no Coolant was in them while a minimal amount of Power was left over and they did not have any Rods.
- [FIXED] IC2-Classic Watermills should now accept Ocean and River Water. This requires a pending update on the IC2-Classic Side aswell.
- [FIXED] GT6 Tools should now work with Treecapitator installed as long as Treecapitator detects them as valid Tools.
- [FIXED] A Rare NEI Recipe List Crash. (Concurrent Modification Exception when clicking Progress Bar)
- [FIXED] Bedrock Ores did not generate Indicator Flowers and Indicator Rocks in Twilight Forest due to its Terrains normal Height of Y31 instead of Y63.
- [FIXED] The Code that made Plates, Ingots and Rocks placeable did not check if the Stack was already a Block, meaning it just replaced things like Greatwood Planks or Silverwood Planks with the Stack-of-Plates Block.
- [FIXED] Gearboxes sometimes breaking/overloading on World Load.
- [FIXED] Some Issue with Coke Ovens and other Ignition based Basic Machines, hopefully.
- [FIXED] Bumbliaries were lacking Tooltips.

- [CHANGED] Coke Ovens now have 9 Output Slots due to the Recipe that outputs 5/6 Chunks of Coal Coke, so that each Coke Chunk gets 1 Slot.
- [ADDED] Chili Crop which was missing.
- [ADDED] Snow Golems can have their poop picked up by GT6 Hoppers automatically without constantly breaking a Snow Layer Block. Also works with Et Futurums silent replacement for Snow Golems, yes I luckily noticed that...
